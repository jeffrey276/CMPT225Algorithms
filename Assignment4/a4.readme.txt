For my program, I used the implementation file and header file from Lab 4: LL2.cpp and LL2.h
I added the following operations: 

GetLargest() - obtained from http://www.bitsbyta.com/2011/03/how-to-find-largest-element-in-singly.html
removeDuplicates() - obtained from http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/remove-duplicates-from-an-unsorted-linked-list/
isEmpty() - myself

My program works as the following:
1. Read inputs from text file and insert into linked list
2. Remove duplicates
3. Using recursion, I use GetLargest() and compare in list 1 and list 2. 
If there is a largest value in list 1, but not in list 2, the program should find the value
4. Outputs "None" otherwise.
